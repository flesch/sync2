# Sync2

**Sync2** lets you test what you're working on across multiple browsers - without installing or configuring anything. WebSockets are used to connect browsers.

Point your desktop and mobile browsers to [http://sync2.herokuapp.com/](http://sync2.herokuapp.com/).

To connect browsers, enter the same Room ID in each browser. Once you've joined a room, use the form to load a site on connected browser at the same time.

*This is a work in progress, and missing a bunch of features.*
